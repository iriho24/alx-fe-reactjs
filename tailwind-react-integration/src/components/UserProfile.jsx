3. Adding Advanced Interactivity and Transitions with Tailwind CSS
mandatory
Objective: Enhance the UserProfile component with interactive elements such as hover effects, transitions, and animations using Tailwind CSS, to improve user experience and engagement.

Task Description:
This task involves adding sophisticated visual feedback and dynamic effects to the UserProfile component using Tailwind CSS’s built-in utilities for transitions and animations. You’ll make the component more interactive and visually appealing.

Instructions for Adding Interactivity:
Hover Effects:

Apply a hover effect to the profile image to change its scale slightly, giving a sense of interaction when the user points at it.
Example modifications:
Add hover:scale-110 to the image to make it grow slightly on hover.
Include a transition utility to make the scale change smooth (transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out).
Text Emphasis on Hover:

Add a hover effect to the heading so that it changes color when hovered over to indicate it’s an interactive element.
Example modifications:
Change the text color to a lighter shade of blue on hover (hover:text-blue-500).
Enhanced Shadows on Card Hover:

Increase the shadow of the entire card when the mouse hovers over it to create a lifting effect.
Example modifications:
Use hover:shadow-xl on the container to enhance the shadow during hover.
